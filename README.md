## Features

### Animation Type 1: Radiating Arc Explosion (`index.html`)
- 14 pixels radiate outward from center with curved trajectories
- Smooth arcing paths using physics-based movement
- 5-second animation duration
- Click anywhere to trigger

### Animation Type 2: In-Place Firework Explosion (`index2.html`)
- 6 distributed explosions across the canvas
- 3-phase animation: single pixel â†’ cross â†’ expanded pattern
- Realistic fade-out effect with maintained glow
- Staggered timing for wave effect

## Technical Details
